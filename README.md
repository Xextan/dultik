# xextan.hs

this is a (*very bad*) xextan parser. it returns all valid parses.

"why is it very bad" i hear you ask.
- it is **incredibly** slow. wanna parse "xoi len sin"? have fun waiting for 27 minutes
- it is not uptodate with current xextan (though neither is the PEG its based on)
- also it doesnt keep track of the parse structure yet which is kind of silly
